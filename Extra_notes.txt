IN Polt() fucntion

arange() is one of the array creation routines based on numerical ranges. It creates an instance of ndarray with evenly spaced values and returns the reference to it.

Syntax: numpy.arange([start, ]stop, [step, ], dtype=None)

The first three parameters determine the range of the values, while the fourth specifies the type of the elements:

1.start is the number (integer or decimal) that defines the first value in the array.
2.stop is the number that defines the end of the array and isn’t included in the array.
3.step is the number that defines the spacing (difference) between each two consecutive values in the array and defaults to 1.
dtype is the type of the elements of the output array and defaults to None.    

The xticks() and yticks() function takes a list object as argument. The elements in the list denote the positions on corresponding action where ticks will be displayed.                                                                                                                            
Matplotlib.pyplot.legend()
A legend is an area describing the elements of the graph. In the matplotlib library, there’s a function called legend() which is used to Place a legend on the axes.

Syntax-matplotlib.pyplot.legend([“blue”, “green”], bbox_to_anchor=(0.75, 1.15), ncol=2)

The Following are some more attributes of function legend() :

shadow: [None or bool] Whether to draw a shadow behind the legend.It’s Default value is None.
markerscale: [None or int or float] The relative size of legend markers compared with the originally drawn ones.The Default is None.
numpoints: [None or int] The number of marker points in the legend when creating a legend entry for a Line2D (line).The Default is None.
fontsize: The font size of the legend.If the value is numeric the size will be the absolute font size in points.
facecolor: [None or “inherit” or color] The legend’s background color.
edgecolor: [None or “inherit” or color] The legend’s background patch edge color.
